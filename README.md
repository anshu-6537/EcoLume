- **Adaptive Brightness:** The app adjusts the brightness of public lights dynamically, providing adequate illumination for safety without unnecessary energy wastage.

### 2. Accident Prediction
- **Data Analysis:** By analyzing historical accident data and real-time traffic patterns, EcoLume predicts potential accident-prone areas and alerts authorities to take preventive measures such as installing warning signs or implementing traffic calming measures.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Leveraging machine learning algorithms, the app continuously improves its accuracy in predicting accident hotspots, contributing to proactive accident prevention strategies.

### 3. Road Maintenance
- **Pothole Detection:** EcoLume employs image recognition technology to detect potholes and road surface deterioration, notifying relevant authorities for timely repairs.
- **Maintenance Scheduling:** The app generates maintenance schedules based on road condition data, optimizing resource allocation and reducing response times for repairs.

### 4. Faulty Light Detection
- **Real-time Monitoring:** EcoLume monitors the status of public lights in real-time, detecting faults such as outages or flickering bulbs.
- **Alerts and Maintenance Requests:** Users can report faulty lights directly through the app, triggering maintenance requests for prompt resolution.

### 5. Ecosystem Safeguard
- **Environmental Impact Assessment:** EcoLume evaluates the environmental impact of public lighting infrastructure, considering factors such as light pollution and energy consumption.
- **Eco-friendly Solutions:** The app recommends eco-friendly lighting technologies and strategies to minimize environmental harm while ensuring public safety.
